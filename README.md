# Hematology Web Lab
<br> 
This readme details the Hematology Web Lab, a web application I developed during my second year's first semester. It leverages a combination of modern web development and machine learning techniques to predict anemia based on blood test results.
<br>

<br>
Project Overview: 
The Hematology Web Lab offers a user-friendly platform for predicting anemia. Users can register for an account and utilize the prediction service by providing their Hemoglobin, MCH, MCV, MCHC values, and gender information. The application leverages machine learning models to analyze this data and provide an anemia prediction. 
<br>
The tech stack incorporated in this project includes: MERN, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
<br>

Features: <br>
1. User Registration: Users can create accounts by providing essential details.
2. User Login: Registered users can securely access the application using their credentials.
3. Prediction Service: Users can input blood test values and gender to receive anemia predictions.
<br>
